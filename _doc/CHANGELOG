v0.0.13: Improve compatibility, fix crontab bug

Dialog/whiptail prompts were breaking on some systems with old
versions of these programs. This has been fixed by disabling the
use of whiptail in favour of dialog, which indicates with a different
error code when it doesn't support a passed option, unlike whiptail.
This allows acmetool to fallback to stdio prompting.

You can also force the use of stdio prompts using --stdio.

Crontabs installed at system level were invalid due to their omission
of a username. This regression was introduced when introducing support
for user-level crontabs. This has now been fixed.

There were still some references to Let's Encrypt invitations in the
quickstart UI. These have now been removed.
